`fstl` is a viewer for [.stl files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_\(file_format\)).

Here's a screenshot:

It is designed to quickly load and render very high-polygon models;
showing 2 million triangles at 60+ FPS on a mid-range laptop.

For more details, see the [project page](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/fstl).

Issues and pull requests are welcome;
the project is under 1K lines of code and should be fairly approachable.
